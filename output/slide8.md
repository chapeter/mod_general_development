## A Stateless Aspiration

The 12 Factor Application describes a goal of a **stateless application**.  The refers to the goal that applications (and their components) should be able to come and go without any overall impact to the user or data.  This is core to the ablity to be fully "cloud native" and drive towards fully automated operations and portablity.  

This is a great target goal, and for many applications, or microservices within an application, it is useful and practical.  But as an overall strategy it has some significant problems that are important to be aware of.
