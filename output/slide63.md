#### Is OpenSource "Free"?

No... sorta... not really... 

OpenSource licenses often require the software be free to distribute, but there is typically no limitation on charging for Support, Installation, Troubleshooting, etc.  ie RedHat's Model 

Also, developing OpenSource software is no simpler than developing proprietary software.  Some projects are done as side projects, but many are done by paid programmers.
