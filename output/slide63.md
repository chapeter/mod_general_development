One of the nicest things about Vagrant, is the ability to embed the development environment into the code repositories.  You will find many code repo's that include a Vagrantfile to make development easier.  

* Take a look at the [hpreston/myhero_data](https://github.com/hpreston/myhero_data) repo and read through the README section on development environments.  
* Clone the repo locally and "vagrant up" the environment and try to interact with the microservice API.  
* Review the Vagrantfile and Vagrantfile.host and see if you can follow how they work together to provide a Docker environment with Vagrant
