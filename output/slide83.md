Whenever possible, any code that is going to be deployed as part of a CI/CD pipeline should include test cases. Ensuring
that a project has a good testing suite provides the following benefits:

* Requires less background knowledge for other developers to contribute
* Reduces failed deployments
* Makes code refactoring easier
* Helps identify where additional validation logic is required
