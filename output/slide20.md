The following examples leverage the Weather.com API.  Developer access to the API is free and accounts can be created at [wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/).  You will need an API key to follow along with the examples.  

Once you have your API key, run this command at your command line to store your API key as a local environment variable.  

```
export WEATHER_API_KEY=<YOUR KEY>
```
