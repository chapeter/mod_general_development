## Why Do We Care? 

OpenSource has always been popular, but its popularity is raising at a very fast level.  We are seeing large enterprises, across verticles, embracing OpenSource Software like never before.  And this is in some very critical areas where traditionally they would have selected a more traditional commercial vendor.  Even commercial software vendors, traditionally very anti-OpenSource, are starting to embrace OpenSource in a big way.  This could be as a user, contributor, or initiator of projects.  

Not all OpenSource projects and licenses are the same though, and as you jump into this world as an individual, you need to be able to differentiate between the different licenses that you'll run into so you can make apprporiate decisions about which projects to use and contribute to.  Also, deciding on an appropriate license for your own projects is an important decision that can have significant consequenses.
