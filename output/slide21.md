The following examples will use the Cisco Spark API.  You'll need to have access to your Spark Developer Token to complete the exercises.  Find it at [developer.ciscospark.com](https://developer.ciscospark.com).  

Once you have your API key, run these commands at your command line to store your API key and some other details as a local environment variable.  

```
export SPARK_TOKEN=<YOUR TOKEN>
export MY_EMAIL=<YOUR EMAIL>
export PARTNER_EMAIL=<A LAB PARTNERS EMAIL>
```
