The python community provides guidance on coding convention and style through [PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Linters are a good way of verifying that the code you have written conforms to PEP.  A simple example of a linter for python is [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) which is available via pypi

```
pip install flake8 
```
