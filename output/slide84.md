### Why do we care

It is up to the developer today to consider dependencies when building applciations, and if you follow the 12 Factor App principals, declaration and islotation are critical.  As we're setting out to build application demos, understanding how to address dependencies is critical to providing useful applicaitons, and not just toy-code.  

Every language and framework for development has dependencies.  One part of learning a language you plan to use for application or demo development needs to be a consideration on how they are handled and documented.  You'll want to find the equivelant of *pip* in whichever langague you are using.
